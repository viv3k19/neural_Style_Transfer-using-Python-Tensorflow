# Neural Style Transfer
This project implements neural style transfer, a technique that combines the style of one image with the content of another image, resulting in a stylized output image. It utilizes a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub for arbitrary image stylization.

## Introduction
Neural style transfer is a popular technique in computer vision and deep learning that allows the artistic style of one image to be applied to the content of another image. It has gained attention for its ability to generate visually appealing and unique images by combining the content and style features extracted from different images.

## Functionality
The main functionality of this project is to perform neural style transfer on images. It takes a content image and a style image as inputs, and applies the style of the style image to the content of the content image. The resulting stylized image combines the content details of the content image with the artistic style of the style image.

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that all the prerequisites are installed (see below).
2. Clone the repository or download the necessary files.
3. Run the provided neuralStyleTransfer.ipynb Jupyter Notebook to perform neural style transfer on the provided content and style images.
4. Optionally, uncomment the GUI implementation code in neuralStyleTransferGUI.py and run the script for an interactive GUI experience.
5. Provide the paths to the content and style images.
6. The project will generate a stylized image by combining the style of the style image with the content of the content image.

## Features
* Neural style transfer for image stylization
